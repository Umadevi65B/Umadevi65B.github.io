## Hello, Welcome to Uma's Website.  

This is my first Github Website. Very Excited! 

**About Me:**

*Introduction to Global Power Plant Database.*  
A comprehensive, global, open-source database of power plants.  

URL: [Global Power Plant Database](https://datasets.wri.org/dataset/globalpowerplantdatabase)  

Global Power Plant Dataset plays very important role in energy sector as it helps to improve overall efficiency of power plants. It centralizes power plant data to make it easier to navigate, compare, and draw insights for one’s own analysis. The database covers approximately 30,000 power plants from 164 countries and includes thermal plants (e.g., coal, gas, oil, nuclear, biomass, waste, geothermal) and renewables (e.g., hydro, wind, solar). Each power plant is geolocated, and entries contain information on plant capacity, generation, ownership, and fuel type. The database will be continuously updated as data becomes available.
World Resources Institute (WRI) and its partners have created the Global Power Plant Database (GPPD) as an open-source, open-access dataset of the world’s power 2 | plants (Byers et al. 2018). It is assembled from hundreds of public sources and contains information on technical characteristics of power plants, including capacity (megawatts), location, and fuel type.

As a new student of Big Data Analytics, it’s very important to learn some basics about data science. Therefore, I am interested in this book as
this book introduces the theme of Data Science, presents the tools necessary to work with the area, and expands the background a little. It basically works as an introduction to the subject, but it is very well written, with infographics and illustrations that are especially creative. And there is a section that should be printed by everyone working in the field, a guide on how to choose the right technique for each piece of the problem.
